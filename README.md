# reference-for-analyses
I accumulated these code snippets while completing required coursework for my degree in applied statistics. I have them organized by class (one file per class) and then by analysis task (one chunk per task). Files include language meant to accompany analyses.

Disclaimer: This is an ongoing effort to organize skills learned via notes, assignments, and projects and as of today is an incomplete directory.
